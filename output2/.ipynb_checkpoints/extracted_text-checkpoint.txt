ORGANISATIONAL MANAGEMENT

Organizational Management

In this step, you make the necessary system settings for the
implementation of the "Organizational Management" component.

“Organizational Management" forms the base for the Personnel
Planning and Development area (as well as Organizational
Management, this includes the Personnel Development, Personnel
Cost Planning and Training and Event Management components) and
allows you to analyze and adjust your organizational plan as well as
maintain structure data.

Enterprise Structure

We will learn how to portray the specific organizational structure of
business in the R/3 System.

To help you portray your company structure, different Accounting,
Logistics and Human Resources organization units are provided.

First analyze the structures and procedures in your company, and then
match them to the SAP structures. There are various organization
elements defined as examples in the standard version. Normally these
would not cover all your needs. Extend the elements as required.

During the clarification stage, work with the structures delivered by SAP.
In order to obtain a high degree of identification and acceptance from
project members and user departments from the start, you may have to
change some of SAP's terminology.

Enterprise structure shows the relation between 2 organizational units
created.

It is the base line for every functional consultant.

2. Edit, Copy , delete , check company code

The company code is an organizational unit used in accounting. It is used to structure the business organization from a
financial accounting perspective.

We recommend that you copy a company code from an existing company code. This has the advantage that you also copy
the existing company code-specific parameters. If necessary, you can then change certain data in the relevant application.
This is much less time-consuming than creating a new company code. See "Recommendations" for more details about
copying a company code.

If you do not wish to copy an existing company code, you can create a new company code and make all the settings yourself.
You define your company codes by specifying the following information:

e Company code key

You can select a four-character alpha-numeric key as the company code key. This key identifies the company code
and must be entered when posting business transactions or creating company code-specific master data, for
example.

e Company code name
e Address data

The address data is necessary for correspondence and is printed on reports, such as the advance return for tax on
sales/purchases.

e Country currency



Text from output2\page_7.png:
Your accounts must be managed in the national currency. This currency is also known as the local currency or the
company code currency. Amounts that are posted in foreign currency are translated into local currency.

Country key

The country key specifies which country is to be seen as the home country; all other countries are interpreted as
"abroad". This is significant for business and payment transactions because different forms are used for foreign
payment transactions. This setting also enables you to use different address formatting for foreign correspondence.

e Language key

The system uses the language key to determine text automatically in the language of the relevant country. This is
necessary when creating checks, for example

3. Define Personnel Area

The personnel area is an organizational unit that represents a
specific area of the enterprise and is organized according to aspects
of personnel, time management and payroll. A personnel area is
divided into several personnel subareas. the personnel subareas
contain the business characteristics. To assign the business
characteristics, you must have set up at least one personnel subarea
for each of your personnel areas even if you do not use personnel
subareas in your enterprise structure.

Example

Company Ford has three production plants in
Germany:

Hamburg,

Cologne and Berlin.

4. Define Personnel sub areas:
A personnel subarea is an organizational unit that represents a specific area of the company
organized according to certain aspects of personnel, time management and payroll. The
following business subtasks belong to the personnel subarea:

¢ Defining of pay scale and wage type structure

¢ Defining planned working hours

¢ Defining appraisal criteria

Example

The Germany site of Company Ford is physically separated by a railroad line. This could
mean that two different tax or employment offices are responsible for the respective areas. In
this case, you would define a personnel area "Berlin" and two personnel subareas.

SIMPLE MAINTENANCE

In SAP HCM Structure can be created in 2 ways:

1. Expert Mode
2. Simple maintenance

Expert mode is all about the organizational structure creation with the unique numbers

Simple Maintenance is all about organizational structure in a tree format

We work with object types

1. O- Organizational units
2. S— Position

3. C—Job

4. A—Work center

5. X—Cost center

6. P— Person

7. US- User

We will learn how to configure Structure and show relationships. There are standard
relationships

For ex: A003, B003, BO07.....
Further Organizational units are categorized into 4 sub units

a) Root of the company:
Name of the organization
b) Parent location:
Main branch of the organization (Headquarter)
c) Geographical location
Locations or branches of the organization
d) Sub- Geographical location
Departments in the Geographical location
