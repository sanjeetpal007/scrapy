ORGANISATIONAL MANAGEMENT 
 
Organizational Management 
In this step, you make the necessary system settings for the 
implementation of the "Organizational Management" component. 
“Organizational Management" forms the base for the Personnel 
Planning and Development area (as well as Organizational 
Management, this includes the Personnel Development, Personnel 
Cost Planning and Training and Event Management components) and 
allows you to analyze and adjust your organizational plan as well as 
maintain structure data. 
 
Enterprise Structure 
We will learn how to portray the specific organizational structure of 
business in the R/3 System. 
To help you portray your company structure, different Accounting, 
Logistics and Human Resources organization units are provided. 
First analyze the structures and procedures in your company, and then 
match them to the SAP structures. There are various organization 
elements defined as examples in the standard version. Normally these 
would not cover all your needs. Extend the elements as required. 
During the clarification stage, work with the structures delivered by SAP. 
In order to obtain a high degree of identification and acceptance from 
project members and user departments from the start, you may have to 
change some of SAP's terminology. 
Enterprise structure shows the relation between 2 organizational units 
created. 
It is the base line for every functional consultant.

Configurations for Enterprise structure 
Definitions: 
1. Define Company  
 
 
 
Update the required fields enter and save 
 
6 
 
6 
 
 
Save in Customising request.(TR- Transport Request) 
 
2. Edit, Copy , delete , check company code 
 The company code is an organizational unit used in accounting. It is used to structure the business organization from a 
financial accounting perspective. 
We recommend that you copy a company code from an existing company code. This has the advantage that you also copy 
the existing company code-specific parameters. If necessary, you can then change certain data in the relevant application. 
This is much less time-consuming than creating a new company code. See "Recommendations" for more details about 
copying a company code. 
If you do not wish to copy an existing company code, you can create a new company code and make all the settings yourself. 
You define your company codes by specifying the following information: 
• 
Company code key 
You can select a four-character alpha-numeric key as the company code key. This key identifies the company code 
and must be entered when posting business transactions or creating company code-specific master data, for 
example. 
• 
Company code name 
• 
Address data 
The address data is necessary for correspondence and is printed on reports, such as the advance return for tax on 
sales/purchases. 
• 
Country currency 
 
7 
 
7 
Your accounts must be managed in the national currency. This currency is also known as the local currency or the 
company code currency. Amounts that are posted in foreign currency are translated into local currency. 
• 
Country key 
The country key specifies which country is to be seen as the home country; all other countries are interpreted as 
"abroad". This is significant for business and payment transactions because different forms are used for foreign 
payment transactions. This setting also enables you to use different address formatting for foreign correspondence. 
• 
Language key 
The system uses the language key to determine text automatically in the language of the relevant country. This is 
necessary when creating checks, for example 
 
 
 
8 
 
8 
 
Update the required details and save. 
 
3. Define Personnel Area  
The personnel area is an organizational unit that represents a 
specific area of the enterprise and is organized according to aspects 
of personnel, time management and payroll. A personnel area is 
divided into several personnel subareas. the personnel subareas 
contain the business characteristics. To assign the business 
characteristics, you must have set up at least one personnel subarea 
for each of your personnel areas even if you do not use personnel 
subareas in your enterprise structure. 
Example 
Company Ford has three production plants in  
Germany:  
Hamburg, 
Cologne and Berlin.  
 
9 
 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10 
 
10 
 
 
 
Update the personnel areas, enter and save 
 
4. Define Personnel sub areas: 
A personnel subarea is an organizational unit that represents a specific area of the company 
organized according to certain aspects of personnel, time management and payroll. The 
following business subtasks belong to the personnel subarea: 
• Defining of pay scale and wage type structure 
• Defining planned working hours 
• Defining appraisal criteria 
Example 
The Germany site of Company Ford  is physically separated by a railroad line. This could 
mean that two different tax or employment offices are responsible for the respective areas. In 
this case, you would define a personnel area "Berlin" and two personnel subareas. 
 
11 
 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12 
 
12 
 
 
 
 
Update the personnel areas enter and save. 
 
 
13 
 
13 
5. Define Employee groups: 
The employee group allows you to divide your employees into groups and allows you to 
define their relationship to the enterprise. The following essential organizational functions 
can be carried out using the employee group: 
• generating default values when entering data; for example, for the payroll accounting 
area or for the basic pay of the employee 
• generating a selection criterion for evaluations 
• generating a unit for the authorization check 
Example 
You want to distinguish your employees between persons actively employed, pensioners and 
early retirees 
 
 
 
14 
 
14 
 
 
ENTER THE EMPLOYEE GROUP CODES AND DESCRIPTION, SAVE. 
6. Define Employee sub group: 
The employee subgroup represents a subdivision of the employee group. When you define 
employee subgroups, you are essentially begun to set up your personnel structure. Features 
are allocated to this in later steps. These steps are dealt with at the spot where they are 
established in a business sense. 
The following business subtasks are provided among other things: 
• specification of processing in payroll accounting 
• specification of validity of primary wage types 
• specification of validity of work schedules 
• specification of validity of pay scale groups 
• specification of validity of time quota types 
 
 
 
15 
 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
16 
 
16 
 
 
Enter the sub group codes, enter and save. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
17 
 
17 
ASSIGNEMENTS: 
1.Assign Company code to company  
 
 
 
 
 
18 
 
18 
 
2. Assignment of personnel area to company code 
 
 
 
 
 
19 
 
19 
 
3. Assignement of Employee group to Employee subgroup: 
 
 
 
Enter and save. 
 
20 
 
20 
ORGANISATIONAL MANAGEMENT 
 
1.Set up number assignment for all plan versions 
 
 
 
See that value abbreviation as 01 
 
21 
 
21 
 Enter and save. 
2. Maintain number ranges 
 
 
 
 
 
 
22 
 
22 
3. Maintain object types 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
23 
 
23 
 
3. Maintain Info type: 
 
 
 
 
 
24 
 
24 
4. Set up integration with Personnel Administration 
 
 
 
 
 
 
25

5. Transfer data from Personnel administration: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
26

29 
 
29 
SIMPLE MAINTENANCE 
 
In SAP HCM Structure can be created in 2 ways: 
1. Expert Mode 
2. Simple maintenance 
Expert mode is all about the organizational structure creation with the unique numbers  
Simple Maintenance is all about organizational structure in a tree format  
 
We work with object types 
1. O – Organizational units 
2. S – Position 
3. C – Job 
4. A – Work center 
5. X – Cost center 
6. P – Person 
7. US- User 
We will learn how to configure Structure and show relationships. There are standard 
relationships 
For ex: A003, B003, B007….. 
Further Organizational units are categorized into 4 sub units 
a) Root of the company: 
Name of the organization 
b) Parent location: 
Main branch of the organization (Headquarter) 
c) Geographical location 
Locations or branches of the organization  
d) Sub- Geographical location 
Departments in the Geographical location  
             
 
 
 
 
 
30 
 
30 
1. Create Structure: 
 
 
 
Fill up the required details like organistational unit and name . Enter and save. 
 
 
31 
 
31 
.
